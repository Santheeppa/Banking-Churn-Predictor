## Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for banks, as it directly impacts profitability. This project focuses on analyzing various factors such as customer demographics, account information, and transaction behaviors to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank. By understanding these factors, banks can develop strategies to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about bank customers and includes the following key columns:

1. **RowNumber:** Unique identifier for each record and does not contribute directly to the analysis.
2. **CustomerId:** Used to track and differentiate individual customers within the dataset.
3. **Surname:** Provides information about the family name of each customer.
4. **CreditScore:** Numerical value that assesses the creditworthiness of an individual based on their credit history and financial behavior.
5. **Geography:** Provides information about the customers' geographic distribution, allowing for analysis based on regional or national factors.
6. **Gender:** Categorizes customers as either male or female, enabling gender-based analysis if relevant to the churn prediction.
7. **Age:** Represents the customer's age in years and can be used to analyze age-related patterns and behaviors.
8. **Tenure:** Typically represents the number of years or months the customer has been associated with the bank.
9. **Balance:** Reflects the amount of money in the customer's bank account at a specific point in time.
10. **NumOfProducts:** Number of products the customer has with the bank, such as savings accounts, loans, credit cards, etc.
11. **HasCrCard:** Binary variable with a value of 1 if the customer possesses a credit card and 0 otherwise.
12. **IsActiveMember:** Binary variable indicating whether the customer is an active member (1) or not (0) within the bank.
13. **EstimatedSalary:** Provides an approximation of the customer's income level, which can be relevant for analyzing churn behavior.
14. **Exited:** Indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0) from the bank. It is the variable we aim to predict using the other features.

## Key Features and Methods

1. **Data Processing:**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Investigated distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the data.
   - Identified key factors influencing customer churn.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features based on customer behaviors and demographics.
   - Selected features based on importance scores.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Trained machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Santheeppa/Banking-Churn-Predictor.git
   cd Banking-Churn-Predictor
   ```
2. Run Jupyter notebooks for data processing, analysis, and training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and analysis

Hey there! ðŸ˜Š


I did this project after referring to many projects from Kaggle and GitHub. I learned numerous new methods through them and applied many of them in this project. There is still more to learn, and I am committed to doing my best in future projects as well.Thanks so much for your support and understanding!

Cheers, [Santheeppa]
